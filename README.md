## Overview

This is a project by the Targaryen team in the Android Developer Immersive 1 at the San Francisco campus. This application is intended to be a replica of the current New York Times Breaking News mobile application. Users will be able to see a feed of articles based on the section or category of the article. Users will receive notifications based on sections the user has chosen to follow, every hour. When an article is clicked on, the user will be taken to a webview of that article. The user can share the article on various social networks as well through other apps on the users phone. The user will be able to search through articles by keywords.
